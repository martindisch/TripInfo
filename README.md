# TripInfo
A simple command-line application showing real-time data for selected public transportation in Switzerland.
This is a quick and dirty implementation to test the APIs of the new open data platform for Swiss public transportation.
This is to say that there's not much error handling going on, if you want to crash it you can easily do so.

The data is provided by the [Open Data Platform Swiss Public Transport](https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/).
